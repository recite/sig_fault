I attach the final database / excel sheet. Each line is one of the papers that we examined, in which the authors describe at least one situation in which they might be tempted to make “the error” that our paper is about. I think the meaning of most columns will be clear. The colored column called “Main Q” indicates whether in our opinion “the problem” occurs (YES) or does not occur (NO) in that paper. Please do not share this Excel sheet with anyone outside your group of collaborators. And let me know if anything is unclear.
